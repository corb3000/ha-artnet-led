# Home Assistant component for Art-Net LED (DMX)

Updated integration Supporting the new color mode in Home Assistant. leveraged heavily form [spacemanspiff2007](https://github.com/spacemanspiff2007/home-assistant-artnet) and [jnimmo](https://github.com/jnimmo/hass-dmx)
Now supports 16 bit resolution (also supports 24 bit and 32 bit but I don't know of a DMX controller that would use it)
Use Brightness and RGB value separately to give more resolution to brightness to be able to make use of 16 bit resolution

The DMX integration for Home Assistant allows you to send DMX values to an [Art-Net](http://www.art-net.org.uk) capable DMX interface. This component is a one way integration which sends [Art-Net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art-Net) UDP packets to the DMX interface. This integration uses [pyartnet](https://github.com/spacemanspiff2007/PyArtNet) libraries and requires at least Python version 3.8.

## Configuration

hass-dmx is a community supported Home Assistant integration, if you have any questions you can discuss with the [Home Assistant DMX Community](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/dmx-lighting/2248).

artnet-led lighting is configured in the `configuration.yaml` file under the *light* domain.


Example:

```yaml

\* In the case of a white channel being used in an RGB light fixture, the white channel is automatically calculated.


## Supported features

- Color-Mode. 
    This allows full independent control over: RGB setting, RGB brightness, Cool White brightness and Warm white brightness. with a separate over all brightness control. This allows you to sent the color and white levels to any value independently and then adjust the brightness of the whole light without affecting the color of the light.
- 16 bit DMX output.
    taking advantage of the separate brightness settings and the overall brightness allows lights to be dimmed to very low levels and still have a smooth fade due to the 65K steps you get from 16 bit
- Transition time can be specified through services to fade to a color (for RGB fixtures) or value. This currently is set to run at 25 frames per second. 
- Brightness: Once a channel is turned on brightness can be controlled through the Home Assistant interface.
- Color temperature: For dual channel warm white/cool white fixtures this tunes the white temperature.

### Output correction

- The graph shows different output depending on the output correction.

- Quadratic or cubic results in much smoother and more pleasant fades when using LED Strips.

linear (default when nothing is set), quadratic, cubic then quadruple

#### Limitations

- LEDS must be in same order as shown in channel

- Notes DMX king eDMX4 Pro does not seem to work if you have send less than 16 channels. Work around just add a dummy light at channel 16 or higher

#### Future improvements

- Lights are assigned a unique ID generated from the IP addreess, Port, Universe and Channel.


#### Supported hardware

- Should work with any Art-Net, KiNet or e1.31 sACN enabled DMX interface.
- Artnet interface tested on DMX King eDMX4 and ENTTEC DIN Ethergate 2.
- e1.31 sACN interface tested on esPixelStick and Falcon F16v2
